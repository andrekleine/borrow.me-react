## App Description

Borrow.me is a social networl based on books. Its main focus is on finding out people who would lend (or trade) books. So the app will show you these people and the books they would like to trade with you.
A secondary function of the app is to keep a book reading diary, so you can add the books you've already read, and add reviews to them.
You can also check the reviews on the latest books your friends have read.
